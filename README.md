# LinkInsights

LinkInsights is a powerful tool that allows users to input links from YouTube videos or websites (or both) and scrape data using LangChain's WebLoader and YouTubeLoader. The scraped data is then utilized to generate summaries, reports, or conduct Q&A using large language models (LLMs). This project is implemented in Streamlit, making it easy to interact with and visualize the output.

## Features

- **Input Links**: Accepts both YouTube video links and website links.
- **Data Scraping**: Uses LangChain's WebLoader for websites and YouTubeLoader for video transcripts.
- **Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of the scraped content.
- **Report Generation**: Create detailed reports based on the input data.
- **Q&A Functionality**: Ask questions about the scraped content and receive insightful answers.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Gemini-pro 1.5 for text processing and response generation.

## How It Works

1. **Input the URL**: Provide either a YouTube video link or a website link.
2. **Data Scraping**: The application scrapes relevant data (transcripts or website content).
3. **LLM Processing**: The scraped content is fed into the Gemini Pro 1.5 LLM via LangChain to generate results.
4. **Outputs**: 
    - **Summarization**: A concise summary of the content is displayed.
    - **Q&A**: Ask questions and receive answers from the content.
    - **Report**: A detailed report is generated based on the content.
